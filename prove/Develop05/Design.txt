---------------------------------------- Step 4 ----------------------------------------

What does the program do?
- It helps people keep track of their goals and "reward" them. 

What user inputs does it have?
- The choice of main actions, the kind of goals and other goal-related data, like the name,
a brief description and points given.

What output does it produce?
- It saves, loads and show their progress.

How does the program end?
- When the user choses quit.

---------------------------------------- Step 5 ----------------------------------------
What are good candidates for classes in this program?
- Goals in general (as a parent) and the 3 kinds of goals. Also a class to keep track of 
everything so it's easier to save, load and show.

What are the primary responsibilities of each class?
- The goals classes should take the data input and translate it into a goal ready to be tracked. The
other one I mentioned should show, save and load them.

---------------------------------------- Step 6 ----------------------------------------
What are the behaviors this class will have in order to fulfill its responsibilities? 
(In other words, what things should this class do?)
- 

->Goal manager should save, show and load. Also get a list of goals, also create a record.
->Goal should be a parent and have all the commons, like name, description and points (which all have)
->Simple Goal: the same as the parent and a unique check meant to be checked just once.
->Eternal Goal: about the same but the check space is always empty.
->Checklist Goal: get all the basics from parent and add a count and check from simple list, along
with the bonus points when the number of times is reached.

---------------------------------------- Step 7 ----------------------------------------
What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? 
(In other words, what variables should this 
class store?). What are the data types of these member variables?

-
->Goal manager: List of goals
->Goal(parent): name, description (both string), points worth (int)
->Simple Goal: done or not (boolean)
->Eternal Goal: same as parent
->Checklist Goal: bonus poins when complete(int), tracking


---------------------------------------- Step 8 ----------------------------------------
What constructors should each class have?
-
->Goal manager: score (0)
->Goal(parent): name, description (both string), points worth (int)
->Simple Goal: done or not (False)
->Eternal Goal: same as parent 
->Checklist Goal: amount completed (0), bonus, target.

What other work needs to be done to set up these objects?
- Create a way to record the goals.
